## `eic-shell` compiling

The EIC environment `eic-shell` is a singularity/docker container with a
 curated selection of software components. It is encouraged to use the
 `eic-shell` to save your compiling time.

### Setting up the `eic-shell` environment
Follow the below tutorials to set up the `eic-shell` environment.

As of Sep 13, 2022, the `eic-shell` has the above packages pre-installed.
 The table also lists the `eic-shell` package versions and the versions
 given in the [manual installation guide](Build_bare_metal.md), where "--"
 stands for identical with the left-hand side.


### Further steps

#### 1. Install `ip6` and `epic`
In the `eic-shell` environment, the installation process begins with configuring
 the detectors `ip6` and `epic`.

```bash
export EICTOPDIR=${PWD}

mkdir -p ${EICTOPDIR}/detectors
cd ${EICTOPDIR}/detectors

export IP6_DD4HEP_HOME=${EICTOPDIR}/detectors/ip6
git clone https://github.com/eic/ip6.git ${IP6_DD4HEP_HOME}
cmake -S ${IP6_DD4HEP_HOME} -B ${IP6_DD4HEP_HOME}/build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${IP6_DD4HEP_HOME} -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DUSE_DDG4=OFF
cmake --build ${IP6_DD4HEP_HOME}/build --target install -- -j8

export EIC_DD4HEP_HOME=${EICTOPDIR}/detectors/epic
git clone https://github.com/eic/epic.git ${EIC_DD4HEP_HOME}
ln -s ${IP6_DD4HEP_HOME}/ip6 ${EIC_DD4HEP_HOME}/ip6
mkdir -p ${EIC_DD4HEP_HOME}/share/epic/ip6
ln -s ${IP6_DD4HEP_HOME}/ip6 ${EIC_DD4HEP_HOME}/share/epic/ip6
cmake -S ${EIC_DD4HEP_HOME} -B ${EIC_DD4HEP_HOME}/build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${EIC_DD4HEP_HOME} -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DUSE_DDG4=OFF
cmake --build ${EIC_DD4HEP_HOME}/build --target install -- -j8
```

#### 2. Install `EICrecon`
```bash
cd ${EICTOPDIR}
git clone https://github.com/eic/EICrecon ${EICTOPDIR}/EICrecon
cd ${EICTOPDIR}/EICrecon
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

Once installed successfully, configure the EICrecon environment as below.

```bash
source bin/eicrecon-this.sh
```

## EDPM installation

**edpm** stands for **E**IC **d**evelopment  **p**acket ~~**m**anager~~ helper

**The goal** of edpm is to provide esier experience of building EIC simulation and reconstruction
framework and supporting packages on a user machine with development reasons. It is a user friendly CLI
alternative to build instructions and build scritps that compile EIC chain of packages with right flags.
Something that users can simply do `pip install edpm; edpm install package`.

Very minimal start:

Install edpm itself:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user ejpm
```

Install eicrecon

```sh
# 1. System prerequesties
edpm req ubuntu22           # get list of required OS packets. Use `centos8` on RHEL8  
sudo apt install ...        # install watever 'edpm req' tells you

# 2. Where to install
edpm --top-dir=<where-to>   # Directory where packets will be installed

# 3. Install
edpm install eicrecon       # install 'Geant 4 EIC' and dependencies (like vgm, hepmc)

# 4.  Source environment
source ~/.local/share/edpm/env.sh  # Use *.csh file for tcsh

# Futher help. EDPM has self descriptive help just run
edpm       # current status and installed packaged
edpm --help
```

You have ROOT and Geant4 and donâ€™t want EJPM to build them?(Use your installations of ROOT and Geant4)

```sh
# Before running 'ejpm install g4e'
edpm set root `$ROOTSYS`    # Path to ROOT installation
edpm set geant4 <path>       # Path to Geant4 installation
```

**How to switch of branch of some packet or build threads?**

```sh
# edpm has per packet build config and global config
# all packets have 'branch' config pointing to current tag/branch
edpm config jana2 branch=master   # switch jana2 to install jana2-master branch
edpm config jana2                 # see configs for jana2
edpm config global                # see global configs, such as build threads
```

(!)EDPM is not a real packet manager and don't track dependency chain. In
current EDPM version if you re-insstall some packet to a different version,
you have to reinstall dependent packages yourself. to reinstall some package
(e.g. after edpm update or config change)

```
edpm rm package && edpm install package    # reinstall package

# sometimes on wants to just rebuild a package, without redownloading 
edpm install --forca package   # rebuild package even if it exists
```

**Control environment**

Packets in edpm are connected through environment, LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc.
Every time configuration is changed (something installed or deleted) or
***edpm env*** command is called, edpm creates
2 environment files with the current environment:

```bash
~/.local/share/edpm/env.sh    # bash
~/.local/share/edpm/env.csh    # bash
```

Examples:

1. Dynamically source output of ```edpm env``` command (recommended)

    ```bash        
    source <(edpm env)                # works on bash
    ```
2. Save output of ```edpm env``` command to a file (can be useful)

    ```bash
     edpm env sh  > your-file.sh       # get environment for bash or compatible shells
     edpm env csh > your-file.csh      # get environment for CSH/TCSH
    ```

**Use CLion and others IDE with EDPM**

EDPM is designed to be used with IDEs. In order to use with VSCode or IntelliJ types of IDE:

1. Exit IDE completely (as they use a single produce even when several instances are open)
2. Source EDPM environment
3. Run `clion` or `code` from the terminal where you sources the environment

For more complex cases such as remote or docker development edpm can generate cmake
flags. See `edpm env --help`

## Manual compiling
The bare-metal compiling is not encouraged, but would give you much more freedom in
debugging. Please refer to the [complete guide](Build_bare_metal.md) for the details.
